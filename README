Effect Analysis:
1)Analyze the distribution of reported effects (e.g., relaxed, happy, euphoric) for each strain.
2)Identify strains that are commonly associated with specific effects.
Medical Use:
1)Investigate strains that are reported to be effective for medical conditions (e.g., pain, insomnia, anxiety).
2)Identify strains with potential therapeutic benefits based on reported effects.
Popular Strains:
1)Determine the popularity of different strains based on user ratings or mentions.
2)Identify strains that have won awards or gained recognition.
User Preferences:
1)Explore the relationship between THC levels and user-reported effects.
2)Analyze whether certain terpenes are more commonly associated with positive effects.
Correlation Analysis:
1)Investigate potential correlations between different reported effects.
2)Explore if there are patterns in terpene content based on reported effects.
Effect on Medical Conditions:
1)Analyze which strains are reported to be effective for specific medical conditions.
2)Identify potential strains for different health-related purposes.
Visualization of Strains:
1)Create visualizations (e.g., word clouds, bar charts) to represent the popularity of strains based on user reviews.
Machine Learning Predictions:
1)Build predictive models to estimate the likelihood of a strain being associated with specific effects or medical benefits.
2)Evaluate the accuracy of these models.
Cluster Analysis:
1)Use clustering algorithms to group strains based on similarities in characteristics.
2)Explore whether certain clusters are associated with particular effects or medical uses.
Comparison of Strain Types:
1)Compare characteristics, effects, and medical uses between different types of strains (indica, sativa, hybrid).
Impact of Terpenes:
1)Investigate the impact of individual terpenes on reported effects.
Identify terpenes that are commonly associated with positive or negative experiences.
